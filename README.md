# Digit Recognition

### Working: 
- This is a simple digit recognition application which uses a CNN model trained on the famous mnist dataset to recognize the digits.

- The blackboard is made using pygame library on which we can draw our digits, then they are sent to the model, converted to 28x28 image on which our model is trained on. Then the model predicts the class of the drawing on the blackboard
